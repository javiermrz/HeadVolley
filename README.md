# HeadVolley
## What is it?
It's a **two player game** programmed in C++, using **glut** library.  
The idea was to create a game similar to **HeadSoccer** (the popular football game), but playing **volleyball** in this case. 

## How can I try it?
Just **download** and open the .exe located in the /bin folder. **Have fun!**

Player 1 is controlled with the keys **awd** and Player 2 with **jil**.  
However, there is a **help screen** in the game where controls and rules are explained.

## To be continued...
This README.md is not yet complete. I plan to explain more specific things about the game and attach some  
screen captures along the way.
